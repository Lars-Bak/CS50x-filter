# CS50x-filter
This project is based on the CS50 “Filter” assignment.  
It was developed and tested within the CS50 environment, which provides specific libraries  
and tooling not available in a standard setup. As a result, the program may not run  
outside that environment without modification.  

This repository is published for portfolio purposes to demonstrate my understanding of  
image processing, C programming, and algorithmic problem‑solving.  
All code in this project was written by me.
